# openpulse
A collection of experiments I have run in open-pulse (Qiskit) through IBM Quantum over the last several months (May 2020-). 
Focus is on calibrating hardware parameters (ex. cavity decay rate, T1 inversion time) under different conditions (ex. driven state of cavity).
I am currently conducting research at Princeton to explore how T1 is affected under different conditions, and I generated a lot of these tests and calibrations 
over the summer to help me begin to undersand how the IBM Armonk system works. I hope to eventually explore the hardware behind multi-qubit systems.
